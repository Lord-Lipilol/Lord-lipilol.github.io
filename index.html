        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Maze Solving Remote Control (RC) Car Project explores the exciting realm of autonomous vehicles, commonly known as self-driving cars. In the era of rapidly advancing technology, these vehicles represent a groundbreaking innovation, leveraging artificial intelligence, sensors, and intricate algorithms to navigate roads without direct human intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project revolves around making a compact electrically powered vehicle capable of autonomously navigating through a maze. As a first step, we wanted to see if our car would be able to solve a maze made of one path with a couple of turns. When discussing what algorithms would be necessary for our RC car to solve the maze, we determined that it was highly dependent on the nature of the course, i.e., how long the straights are and the angle of the corners. We also had limitations as to the available space we had to make our setup. The maze was therefore designed to contain only straights and 90 degree turns and would occupy the greatest amount of space that was available at one of our residences. The maze was thus set up with vertical walls made from cardboard that were at least 12 inches off the ground.

	<p>
	    The maze width was at least 24 inches at all instances. The floor was not ideal for our demonstration as it was made from stamped concrete blocks, making the surface rough and uneven in some locations with some blocks set slightly higher than others. This would turn out detrimental to our overall success running our RC car (discussed below). 
	</p>
	<p>
	   In tandem with designing the maze, we then went forward with designing our RC car. 
	</p>

	<h2>RC Car</h2>
	<p>
	One of our overarching goals for this project was to create a product that was interesting for both of us, utilized primarily actors and sensors that were already available to us from previous labs in the class, and for it to be inexpensive to construct. One of the driving factors in conceiving the proposal for this project was our successful implementation of PID control of the previously available DC motor with encoder with the Pololu wheel kit attached to it in an earlier lab. From there, we sought to be unique, with many other examples of RC cars already existing on the internet. We then proposed the idea of making an automated maze solving RC car that would solve a maze made of vertical walls. Given we also had to utilize the myRIO microcontroller, our RC car design is something else that makes our project unique from others found on the internet. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The RC car proposal allowed us to fulfill one of our assignment requirements, that being exploring an advanced topic or a topic that we had not covered previously in the course. Wireless communication with our project, and it counted as our advanced topic. After some research on how to implement WIFI communication with the myRIO, we successfully configured one of our two available microcontrollers with its own password protected network.
	</p>

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ni MyRIO</li>
            <li>6 & 12 V Battery Packs</li>
            <li>1/8 inch thick laser cut chassis, motor mounts, caster wheel mount, servo mount, and lidar mount</li>
            <li>Two DC Motors SKU 290-006 with encoders</li>
	    <li>Two pololu wheels and mounting kits</li> 
            <li>Servo Motor S03TXF STD</li>
            <li>Compass PMOD CMPS2</li>
            <li>LIDAR Sensor MakerFocus TF-Luna</li>
	    <li>Pololu 1" Ball Caster with bearings</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	We then needed to determine what sensors we wanted to use. We decided a good method to determine RC location and orientation was to use the Digilent Pmod CMPS2 3-axis compass, having had success implementing the sensor in an earlier lab. To be able to detect and potentially map the vertical walls of our maze, we knew we needed some sort of distance measuring sensor. We knew that LIDAR sensors were already used in autonomous vehicles, but the price of even the cheapest “true” LIDAR sensor, meaning using laser wavelengths to measure distance, was too great. The range was also not ideal, with some sensors we were consider working with had a minimum detection distance of 1 m and going up to 40 m or more. We then found the TF-Luna LiDAR Range Sensor from Benweke with our research. Although it uses 850nm infrared light and not laser wavelengths, its smaller cost and suitable detection range of 20 cm to 8 m was enough for us to propose the sensor to be purchased, and it was.
	</p>
	<p>
	To give our LiDAR sensor movement capabilities in order to be able to scan its environment while stationary, we used a GWS S03N STD servo motor. We determined from a previous lab that supplying duty cycles between 0.3 and 1.0 then dividing that value by 0.13 would give the servo 180 degrees of precise positioning capabilities. Thus, to get 1 degree resolution out of the servo’s range, we took the range of 0.7 and divided it by 180 equating to 0.00389. Then adding a certain multiple of 0.00389 to 0.3 and then dividing by 0.13 would instruct the servo to move to its corresponding angle. To the naked eye, we can identify the servo move at each new duty cycle sent to it with this method. Our second actor type used for this project were the two 12V DC motors from Sha Yang Ye Industrial Co. used to drive our RC along the ground.
	</p>
	<p>
	With our essential components for our project identified, we then proceeded to design an RC that would be able to hold our myRIO, power sources, sensors, actors and circuits. Using CAD software, specifically SolidWorks, it was easier to determine the spacing of all of our components as we made our design. We then decided to go with a laser cut chassis, motor mounts, and servo mounts made from 1/8 in. thick acrylic having had experience using this technique in a past research experience. A caster wheel was ordered from Pololu, and standoffs, angles brackets, nuts and bolts purchased from McMaster Carr. Careful attention to detail was given in designing the RC so that the caster wheel and Pololu wheels were level. The images below show our CAD design and final project construction.

        <h2>How the System Works</h2>
        <p>
            The vehicle is powered by a 12V battery case. The first step for the car is the initialization process. The car checks that every sensor it has (Compass, LIDAR) operates smoothly. After the initialization process, the car will scan the environment in front of it. It accomplishes this by performing a 180-degree sweep with the LIDAR attached to a servo motor. Once the LIDAR finishes scanning, the car then determines whether it should go straight or turn 90 degrees left or right. The car starts to move forward at a constant speed regulated by a PID controller. It continues until the LIDAR detects an object at a distance of 25 cm. The car then stops and repeats the entire process, from scanning to deciding where to go and moving forward, until another obstacle is encountered.

        <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            To achieve the goals of the Maze Solving Car Project, the following technical requirements were identified:
        </p>
   	<img class = "Centered-image1" src="ME 6705 Project Images/Project Requirements.png" alt="Project Requirements">
	<style>
		.Centered-image1{
      			max-width: 75%; /* Adjust as needed */
      			height: auto;
      			display: block;
		}
	</style>
    <p>
	Interface: Technical requirements were set as being fully automous and to not be confined to power cables attached to walls. To fulfill our advance topic of Wifi communication, we wanted active sensor data to be displayed back on the LabView front panel to the user    
    </p>
    <p>
	Data Capturing: The TF-Luna Lidar that was purchased for us had a working range of 0.2 m – 8m, a range of distances at which our robot was sure to encounter in our maze and therefore it was set as our technical requirement. If we were able to acquire a better LIDAR sensor, the range of that sensor was set as our objective. To achieve the best turns possible, we sought to be able to have our compass resolution be 0.25 degrees.    
    </p>
    <p>
	Dimensions: We were limited in space to build our maze, and so we sought to keep our RC as small and compact as possible. We therefore set our length, width, and height technical requirements so that it would be able to maneuver easily within our maze. Our objective dimensions were reduced even further.    
    </p>
    <p>
	Maze Solving: We went conservative with our technical requirements. We believed solving the maze within 3 to 5 minutes was feasible. We also set the complexity of our technical requirement maze to have just a single route. Our objective requirements reduced the time and added complexity to our maze.      
    </p>
    </section>

        <h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
           <p>
            We encountered several challenges as we worked to complete our project. Our biggest gripe is with the unreliable readouts the CMPS2 compass would give out at certain times. Having had successfully utilized this specific compass in a previous class lab assignment, we were confident in its abilities. Perhaps we failed ot initialize the compass correctly with the increased sampling rates necessary for our code, but the unrealiable spikes in error were detrimental to our ability of turning to the correct angle with the RC car.
        </p>
	    <p>
		Also, we encountered unexpected spikes in wheel speed the second and subsequent times our code returned to the move forward state. In this state, we utilized a control and simulation subsystem to build our PID controller for wheel speed, but it almost appeared as if the system would continue to accumulate error when the code was running in other states. This accumulation in error would cause an undesired initial spike in speed before the PID could return the speed under control. We were beginning to pinpoint potential solutions to this problem, one potential solution was by adding a boolean control to our front panel that would send a FALSE boolean to the "initialize" input of the subsystem. This was difficult to deal with in RC runs, as we had to manually turn on and off the control when the RC left and returned to the move forward state. Further research into understanding where this accumulation of error is coming from is needed.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Finally, given our limited options as to where we can build a maze to demo on, we opted to use the outdoor porch of one of our residencies. This proved to be detrimental, as the porch's floor was made of slightly uneven, stamped concrete blocks. This surface did not allow our RC to run in a straight line and be able to complete its turns in a timely manner. More work had to be done to smooth out the surface for better RC runs.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout this final project, we gained valuable experience in integrating various actuators and sensors to create a cohesive system. The process of combining these elements posed unexpected challenges. In terms of mechatronics systems, we learned a lot on how to integrate continous actor motion with sensor readouts. We were particularly pleased with our Lidar scanning capabilities. This allows us to propose a future step of being able to mount the lidar to a motor that would give it 360 degrees of scanning capabilites. Also, we believe our RC would be able to perform better on rougher terrains with wider, more robust wheels. With our RC running smoother and ensuring accurate positional data is obtained, we would have looked forward in seting up more complex mazes, with different types of turns and even dead ends.
